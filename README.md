This repository is for various prototyping and development of future dijit features.  Work is on branches, not in master.  In particular see the following branches:

   - nodep: Dijit 1.x with all the backwards compatibility code removed, and running against any loader.
   - es5setters: Prototype of Dijit 1.x code running with native getters/setters so that (on IE9+ and other browsers) you can do things like myDialog.title="Hello" and the dialog updates.
